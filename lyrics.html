            <p>On a bridge across the Severn on a Saturday night,</p>
            <p>Susie meets the man of her dreams.</p>
            <p>He says that he got in trouble and if she doesn't mind</p>
            <p>He doesn't want the company</p>
            <p>But there's something in the air</p>
            <p>They share a look in silence and everything is understood</p>
            <p>Susie grabs her man and puts a grip on his hand as the rain puts a tear in his eye.</p>
            <br>
            <p><em>She says</em></p>
            <p><em>Don't let go</em></p>
            <p><em>Never give up, it's such a wonderful life</em></p>
            <p><em>Don't let go</em></p>
            <p><em>Never give up, it's such a wonderful life</em></p>
            <br>
            <p>Driving through the city to the temple station,</p>
            <p>Cries into the leather seat</p>
            <p>And Susie knows the baby was a family man,</p>
            <p>But the world has got him down on his knees</p>
            <p>So she throws him at the wall and kisses burn like fire,</p>
            <p>And suddenly he starts to believe</p>
            <p>He takes her in his arms and he doesn't know why,</p>
            <p>But he thinks that he begins to see</p>
            <br>
            <p><em>She says,</em></p>
            <p><em>Don't let go</em></p>
            <p><em>Never give up, it's such a wonderful life</em></p>
            <p><em>Don't let go</em></p>
            <p><em>Never give up, it's such a wonderful life</em></p>
            <p><em>Don't let go</em></p>
            <p><em>Never give up, it's such a wonderful life</em></p>
            <p><em>Don't let go</em></p>
            <p><em>Never give up, it's such a wonderful life</em></p>
            <p><em>She says</em></p>
            <p><em>Don't let go</em></p>
            <p><em>Never give up</em></p>
            <p><em>Don't let go</em></p>
            <p><em>Never give up, it's such a wonderful life</em></p>
            <br>
            <p><span>Wonderful life</span>, <span>Wonderful life</span>, wonderful, wonderful,<span>Wonderful life</span></p>
            <p><span>Wonderful life</span>, <span>Wonderful life</span>, wonderful, wonderful,<span>Wonderful life</span></p>
